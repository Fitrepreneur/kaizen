# Kaizen: The art of continual improvement

### Proposed implementations
[![Feature Requests](http://feathub.com/choderalab/kaizen?format=svg)](http://feathub.com/choderalab/kaizen)

### Concerns
* Lab notebooks
* Instrument status/service/repair calendar
* Lab tutorials / primers / hot topics
  * Patrick Grinaway: Parallel/distributed computing
  * Archive slides/links on website
  * #hot-topics slack channel; use emoticons to vote for favorite topics?
* Mini journal club
  * Integrate with hot topics?
  * each person picks favorite journal to monitor?
  * journal club / emoticon bot?
* Scifinder access
* Focused one-on-one meetings
* Scheduled meetings: Location and goals
* Update network / computational resources spreadsheet
* Update dev boxes / dev box management
* Run F@H on dev boxes when idle
* Realistic project timelines: Strategies?
* Opportunity cost: How should we evaluate potential collaborations?
  * Keep window open to turn them down
  * Exit strategy?
  * Communication strategy / How do we keep timelines and expectations synchronized?
* Wetlab protocol / info organization
  * Currently have Trello, Github, Google Docs, Wiki, etc.
  * Create webpage on Squarespace that indexes all resources?
  * Eventually consolidate?
* Smart Whiteboard / Whiteboard Marker system?
* Offline Google Drive snapshot backups
* Summer Students / Google Summer of Code?
* Fellowships: How to maximize cost/benefit?
* Meeting styles:
  * Enumerate objectives and expected results beforehand
  * First ask if the meeting is worth X person-hours?
  * Meeting follow-up: Make action items explicit
* More whiteboards in lab space
* Move group meetings to Mon mornings at 11 am (instead of lab coffee)
* Individual meetings
  * Have person who called meeting specify what they want to get out of the meeting beforehand
  * Balance of open-ended discussion vs task direction/delegation
* How do we balance cyclic dependencies / project interdependencies / priorities
* Students/postdocs should lead meetings, not JDC
* Students/postdocs should direct their own projects, have total ownership over them, be responsible for timelines/objectives
* Time prioritization
* Lab meetings
  * Continue to have group meetings when JDC isn't around (JDC may send HX instead)
  * Frequency: once/week?
  * One or two presenters/meeting?
  * Length: 45 min vs 1.5 hour?
  * Introduction or skip right to the chase?
* Planning projects
  * Objective + deadline =/= plan!
  * Schedule of minor tasks (Gantt chart / Kanban boards)
  * Tools: Gantt Pro, Trello, others
* Use Slack Hangouts integration to minimize the time required for discussions that involve a few people
* Always add simple examples to our software tools---even those in development---to make it easier for others to figure out how to use them
* Enable Google Inbox for `choderalab.org`
* Ensure there is clear ownership of all lab projects
* Manage/reduce project interdependencies when possible
* Use a feature voting engine to determine which implementations should address issues/suggestions
* We do a lot of code development: How can we make sure we don't lose sight of the scientific questions?
* Start meetings on time
* How can we encourage direct, honest feedback?
* Move quickly on new technologies?
* Communicate results more rapidly
* Lead (the field) by example
* Plan R01 task delegation far in advance
* Plan wetlab experiments efficiently. 
  * Should we avoid monthly whole lab meetings?

**Added by RPW on June 8th following Slack discussion - John's summary - on LAB SAFETY and TRAINING and 3D PRINTER**

There are a few things here that are really important:
​* *Unknown material on the lab bench near the balance.*​ This is a very serious problem. Other people in Z17 use the balance and pH meter without our knowledge, and we have little control over this. **Do we need to block/restrict access to these instruments, and/or set up a camera to make sure this is being enforced?**  In the meantime, always approach the lab bench like you don't know what is on it, and that it may be very toxic. We try to limit the toxicity of what we purchase, but we don't know what our neighbors might leave behind!

​* *Appropriate training before using each instrument, or the automation system.*​ This can be very serious. Using an instrument without proper training can cost lives, careers, and freedom. **Always ask before using an instrument for the first time.** We need to compile a list of the training required before use for each instrument in the lab. Since we've grown from 3 people to 12, it's harder to just ask me at this point. For now, @lucelenie should be the gatekeeper for general training, but in future, we will find a more sustainable way to distribute the load. For the automation system, @sonyahanson is the only one to complete ​*all*​ training, but we don't want to overburden her; for now, I suggest we approach @lucelenie and @sonyahanson to briefly discuss any new procedure to be performed on the robot to determine what training is needed, and we will develop a more scalable system in the near future.

​* *Keeping technical debt at a minimum is the key to a sustainable laboratory.*​ In order for this to work, we will use the automation system for a few key protocols that will be run over and over again. The automation system is designed to allow use of the instruments manually (with proper training) with minimal interference, but it takes so long to develop new protocols that we need to focus on a few protocols that we will reuse many times. I've gone over this with @patrickgrinaway and @sonyahanson a bit, but we can have a longer discussion about this with the whole lab soon.

​* *Maintenance of the 3D printer*​ has become an issue that I am working to resolve. This should really only require minimal effort from @lucelenie to sustain and very rudimentary training on what needs to be done each use. We have a problem right now because the people with the service contract are disputing the terms of payment. This should be resolved soon. If you have pressing 3D printing needs, see me.

​* *IF YOU SEE A SAFETY ISSUE*​ BRING IT TO @lucelenie and I IMMEDIATELY.  DO NOT WAIT.  ​*THIS IS IMPORTANT.*​ Your health and safety is of paramount importance.
