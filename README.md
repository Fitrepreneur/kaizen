# Kaizen: The art of continual improvement

## 5 May 2016 suggestions
* Lab notebooks
* Instrument status/service/repair calendar
* Lab tutorials / primers / hot topics
  * Patrick Grinaway: Parallel/distributed computing
  * Archive slides/links on website
  * #hot-topics slack channel; use emoticons to vote for favorite topics?
* Mini journal club
  * Integrate with hot topics?
  * each person picks favorite journal to monitor?
  * journal club / emoticon bot?
* Scifinder access
* Focused one-on-one meetings
* Scheduled meetings: Location and goals
* Update network / computational resources spreadsheet
* Update dev boxes / dev box management
* Run F@H on dev boxes when idle
* Realistic project timelines: Strategies?
* Opportunity cost: How should we evaluate potential collaborations?
  * Keep window open to turn them down
  * Exit strategy?
  * Communication strategy / How do we keep timelines and expectations synchronized?
* Wetlab protocol / info organization
  * Currently have Trello, Github, Google Docs, Wiki, etc.
  * Create webpage on Squarespace that indexes all resources?
  * Eventually consolidate?
* Smart Whiteboard / Whiteboard Marker system?
* Offline Google Drive snapshot backups
* Summer Students / Google Summer of Code?
* Fellowships: How to maximize cost/benefit?
* Meeting styles:
  * Enumerate objectives and expected results beforehand
  * First ask if the meeting is worth X person-hours?
  * Meeting follow-up: Make action items explicit
* More whiteboards in lab space
* Move group meetings to Mon mornings at 11 am (instead of lab coffee)
* Individual meetings
  * Have person who called meeting specify what they want to get out of the meeting beforehand
  * Balance of open-ended discussion vs task direction/delegation
* How do we balance cyclic dependencies / project interdependencies / priorities
* Students/postdocs should lead meetings, not JDC
* Students/postdocs should direct their own projects, have total ownership over them, be responsible for timelines/objectives
* Time prioritization
* Lab meetings
  * Continue to have group meetings when JDC isn't around (JDC may send HX instead)
  * Frequency: once/week?
  * One or two presenters/meeting?
  * Length: 45 min vs 1.5 hour?
  * Introduction or skip right to the chase?
* Planning projects
  * Objective + deadline =/= plan!
  * Schedule of minor tasks (Gantt chart / Kanban boards)
  * Tools: Gantt Pro, Trello, others
* Use Slack Hangouts integration to minimize the time required for discussions that involve a few people
* Always add simple examples to our software tools---even those in development---to make it easier for others to figure out how to use them
* Enable Google Inbox for `choderalab.org`
* Ensure there is clear ownership of all lab projects
* Manage/reduce project interdependencies when possible
* Use a feature voting engine to determine which implementations should address issues/suggestions
* We do a lot of code development: How can we make sure we don't lose sight of the scientific questions?
* Start meetings on time
* How can we encourage direct, honest feedback?
* Move quickly on new technologies?
* Communicate results more rapidly
* Lead (the field) by example
* Plan R01 task delegation far in advance
